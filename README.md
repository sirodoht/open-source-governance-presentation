# Open Source Governance

Presentation on how open source projects govern themselves.

## Description

In this talk we explore how small and, especially, large open source software
projects govern themselves. After a brief history of the open source movement,
we will examine the governance structure of some of the most popular open
source projects, including Linux, Python, Git. Finally, we will briefly explore
the open source movement and its governance through a perspective of social
theory.
